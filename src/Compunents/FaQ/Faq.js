                        <p>Study Point does not currently offer entire degree programs online. The Online Learning program is a set of lower division general education courses that can be applied to an associate or bachelor's degree. Transferring these credits to any institution of higher learning is possible after admission criteria are met at that institution and upon review of the requested transfer credits by the transferring-in institutionâ€™s registrar.</p>
